# Monkey Programming Languge Interpreter Written in Rust
Took the idea from Thorsten Ball's ["Writing an Interpreter in Go"](https://interpreterbook.com/) book. Wrote it in [Go](https://github.com/MaxIvanyshen/monkey-interpreter/) This is my second attempt on writing my own interpreter and this time in Rust since I wanted to acquire some new knowledge in this language. Also added ability to interpet a file and not only run a REPL, plus added strings on my own. Thinking on adding loops, arrays and structs
